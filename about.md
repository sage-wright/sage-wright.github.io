title: Hi, I'm Sage
---

I am passionate about public health, bioinformatics, cats, and gnarly one-liners. With a BS in Bioinformatics, and a MSc in Bioinformatics and Genomics, I live in Rhode Island with my partner, son, and fuzzy cat. 

I am currently a Bioinformatics Scientist at Theiagen Genomics, where I am a major contributor to our rapidly growing [codebase](https://www.github.com/theiagen). I've been a part of Theiagen since February 2022.

When not crunching data or writing code, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing the violin in a local community orchestra, saving Hyrule, and reading.
