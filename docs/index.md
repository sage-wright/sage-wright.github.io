# Hi, I'm Sage

I am passionate about public health, bioinformatics, cats, and gnarly bash one-liners. With a BS in Bioinformatics, and a MSc in Bioinformatics and Genomics, I live in Rhode Island with my partner and son.

I am currently a Senior Bioinformatics Developer at Theiagen Genomics, where I am a major contributor to our rapidly growing codebase. I've been a part of Theiagen since February 2022.

When not crunching data or writing code, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing the violin in a local community orchestra, knitting, or reading.
