I read a lot. Here's some of my recent favorites (links are to [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org), which supports independent bookstores!)

- [To Paradise](https://bookshop.org/p/books/to-paradise-hanya-yanagihara/16643172?ean=9780593315651), by Hanya Yanagihara
  
  To Paradise is a _fantastic_ book. Split into three sections, the last one is by far my favorite (and longest). It describes a totalitarion verison of the world where pandemics and plagues occur regularly. Beautifully written by the same author of _A Little Life_ (equally phenomenal), I still think about this book months later -- and not just because I work in public health.

- [The Satanic Verses](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-satanic-verses-salman-rushdie/11727765?ean=9780812976717), by Salman Rushdie

  This classic, first published in 1988, is an incredible story that constantly surprised me. With many books, you can see the plotline unfold ahead of you as common tropes and mechanisms inevitably reoccur across genres and authors. With The Satanic Verses, I had no idea what would happen next. I was constantly surprised. With wild real-world consequences (if you don't know, do some research on the [controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_Verses_controversy) that led to multiple assassination attempts on the author), this book was spectacularly written and imaginative.

- [The Savage Detectives](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-savage-detectives-roberto-bolano/10145596), by Roberto Bola&ntilde;o

  This book is wild and is definitely not for everyone. I wasn't expecting to like this book as much as I did, since the first 140 pages are frankly _bizarre_ and off-putting. I was seriously questioning the cashier who recommended it to me as "the best book he's read in 50 years" and highly considered dropping it. I'm so glad I stuck with it, because once you get to the inteview sections, the book gets a lot better. When you get to those last 150 or so pages, this book goes from good to fantastic.
